## Motivation
Motivated by the inefficiency for the developments of complicated driving scenes, Oneiros aims to:

(1) Provide a toolkit for more efficient and agile developments of complicated driving scenes

(2) Ensure designers can independently undertake most implementations of driving scenes via a to()olkit

Therefore: we derive two key requirements of such a toolkit: 

(1) Preview Functions are very important to allow designers for introspection and rectifications of their designs.

(2) Graphical User Interfaces are also very important to ease designers for creation, adjustments and adaptions of different objects and factors.

## Design


## Implementation Details
Oneiros is implemented in JAVA (the same language as OpenDS). It use MVC design pattern and provide preview and code generation functions.


## User Study
We recruit 11 participants by advertising our study via internal emails, among all students (i.e. 36) involving driving-scene designs previously in our lab. The result is as follows:

**Efficiency Improvements - in terms of Time**(./resource/new-result2d.png)
First, there are 9 participants who save at least 32% time by using Oneiros, compared with the conventional approach. Second, 1 participant saves up to 69% time by using Oneiros. Third, 2 participants only save 5% and 11% time by Oneiros. This is because these two participants are cold-start in using Oneiros, without sufficient practices.

**User Experiences - in terms of Functionality, Interactivity and Convenience**(./resource/new-result2e.png)
For Functionality, 1 participant thinks the functionality of Oneiros tool is good enough, 7 participants think is good, and 3 participants think the functionality is neutral; for Interactivity, all participants consider Oneiros is much more interactive than the conventional approach: 9 of them particularly enjoy the interactivity of Oneiros; for Convenience, 4 participants think using Oneiros is much more convenient than the conventional approach, and 7 participants think Oneiros is more convenient.
