## Motivation
Motivated by the inefficiency for the developments of complicated driving scenes, Oneiros aims to:

Provide a toolkit for more efficient and agile developments of complicated driving scenes

Ensure designers can independently undertake most implementations of driving scenes via a toolkit

Therefore: we derive two key requirements of such a toolkit: 

(1) Preview Functions are very important to allow designers for introspection and rectifications of their designs.

(2) Graphical User Interfaces are also very important to ease designers for creation, adjustments and adaptions of different objects and factors.
